- Financial time series have been found to have the trait of self similarity.

- Project idea: Analysing Fractals to predict future stock price by using past data.

Step 1: Take data of past stock prices in form of CSV file.

Step 2: Calculate statistial values such as variance, mean and standard deviation by using Scipy Library which deals with statistics in Machine Learning.

Step 3: Perform Time series analysis ( Series of data points indexed in discrete time order ) on data by applying MSM model to predict future stock price.
